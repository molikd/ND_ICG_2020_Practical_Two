# ND_ICG_2020_Practical_Two
Practical Two for Introduction to Computational Genomics

This practical is intended to to help you get used to building genomes

Clone this repository, create your own branch (your netid) and modify the practical.sh script:

  1. modify the script so that all of SRR2584863, SRR2584866, SRR2589044 are used in the trimming step and the genome assembly step
  2. a k-mer length of 27 is used in the assembly
  3. use velvetg to only use sequences with a coverage of 5 or more, as well as only configs with a length of 100 or more 
  4. output the contig N50 of the resulting assembly

Once you have completed a script that outputs these answers push your branch to this repository with your modified script.
